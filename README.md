🌿 Plant Disease Detection

This project uses Deep Learning (CNN with TensorFlow/Keras) and Computer Vision (OpenCV) to detect plant leaf diseases from images.

📌 Features

* Train a CNN model on the PlantVillage dataset

* Save and load the trained model (.keras format)

* Predict diseases from single leaf images

* Use OpenCV for preprocessing test images

* Extendable for multiple plant types and diseases

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt



🚀 Training

Run the notebook to train the model:

jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb


After training, the model will be saved as:

plant_disease_model.keras
